# iShapeTriangulation
Complex polygon triangulation. A fast O(n*log(n)) algorithm based on "Triangulation of monotone polygons". The result can be represented as a Delaunay triangulation.

## Features

ðŸ’¡ Fast O(n*log(n)) algorithm based on "Triangulation of monotone polygons"

ðŸ’¡ All code is written to suit "Data Oriented Design". No reference type like class, just structs.

ðŸ’¡ Supports polygons with holes

ðŸ’¡ Supports plain and Delaunay triangulation

ðŸ’¡ Supports breaking into convex polygons

ðŸ’¡ Same points is not restricted

ðŸ’¡ Polygon must not have self intersections

ðŸ’¡ Use integer geometry for calculations

## Basic Usage

Let's imagine you have a polygon like one is shown below:

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/iShape-Swift/iShapeTriangulation/blob/master/Readme/vertices_ordering_rule_0.svg" width="500">

You should list your hull vertices in clockwise direction and your holes vertices in counterclockwise direction

```swift
let points: [CGPoint] = [

  // hule vertices list in clockwise direction
  CGPoint(x: -5, y: 10),
  CGPoint(x: 5, y: 10),
  CGPoint(x: 10, y: 5),
  CGPoint(x: 10, y: -5),
  CGPoint(x: 5, y: -10),
  CGPoint(x: -5, y: -10),
  CGPoint(x: -10, y: -5),
  CGPoint(x: -10, y: 5),
            
  // holes vertices list in counterclockwise direction
  CGPoint(x: -5, y: 0),
  CGPoint(x: 0, y: -5),
  CGPoint(x: 5, y: 0),
  CGPoint(x: 0, y: 5)
]

let hule = points[0...7]
let hole = points[8...11]
        
let triangles: [Int] = Triangulator().triangulateDelaunay(points: points, hull: hule, holes: [hole])

```

After a triangulation you will get an array of indices. Where each triple are represent an indices of the triangle vertices. The indices are always listed in a clock wise direction.
