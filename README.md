# iShapeTriangulation
Complex polygon triangulation. A fast O(n*log(n)) algorithm based on "Triangulation of monotone polygons". The result can be represented as a Delaunay triangulation.

## Features

ðŸ’¡ Fast O(n*log(n)) algorithm based on "Triangulation of monotone polygons"

ðŸ’¡ Supports polygons with holes

ðŸ’¡ Supports plain and Delaunay triangulation

---

## Basic Usage

Let's imagine you have a polygon shown on the picture below:

You should list your hull vertices in clockwise direction and your holes vertices in counterclockwise direction,
as shown on the picture below:
